# Denoise-AE
Deep convolutional autoencoder.  
keras-ae.ipynb use keras with tensorflow backend.  
This project is a homework of deeplearing course of Shenlan College.  
# Results
<img src="re.png">

First row: original images  
Second row: images add Gaussian noise with 0.2 as stddev  
Third row: results with second row as inputs  
Forth row: images add Gaussian noise with 0.9 as stddev  
Fifth row: results with forth row as inputs  
# Usage
