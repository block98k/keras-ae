# Denoise-VAE
Deep convolutional autoencoder and autoencoder.  
Denoise-ae.ipynb use keras with tensorflow backend.  

# Results
<img src="re.png">

First row: original images  
Second row: images add Gaussian noise with 0.2 as stddev  
Third row: Results with second row as inputs  
Forth row: images add Gaussian noise with 0.9 as stddev  
Fifth row: Results with forth row as inputs  
# Usage
```
